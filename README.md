# zipkin-clj

[![Clojars Project][clojars-shield]][clojars-project]

zipkin-clj is a tracing instrumentation library producing trace information
compatible with [Zipkin API v2][zipkin-api]. See [Links][#links] to find out
more about [Zipkin][zipkin] and [Opentracing][opentracing].

## Project status

Early Access: until the version 1.0.0, the API changes with each minor (second)
version number. Bugfix (third) version number is not expected to break the API.

## Installation

[![zipkin-clj @clojars][clojars-info]][clojars-project]

## Usage

### Endpoint info

Before sending traces to Zipkin, it's essential to configure the endpoint
where the tracing events originate from.

``` clojure
(zipkin/set-endpoint! {:service-name "service@host"})
```

### Sending to Zipkin

By default trace information is discarded. In order to send it to Zipkin
(or anywhere else) one must configure the sender. The sender is just a function
taking a list of spans as an argument:

``` clojure
(ns zipkin-clj.example
  (:require [cheshire.core :as json]
            [clj-http.client :as http]
            [zipkin-clj.core :as zipkin]))

(defn- http-trace-sender []
  (let [zipkin-url (str (System/getenv "ZIPKIN_URL") "/api/v2/spans")]
    (fn [spans]
      (let [json-body (json/generate-string spans)]
        (http/post zipkin-url
          {:body json-body
           :content-type :json})))))

(zipkin/set-sender! (http-trace-sender))
```

### B3 trace propagation

_TODO_

``` clojure
;; TODO
```

### Span storage (advanced)

_TODO_

``` clojure

```

## Example
